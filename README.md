# KOReader.modified.browser.cover
This is a modified version of sebdelsolâ€™s browser-folder-cover patch, with the file counter feature removed.
I wasn't a fan of the counter and wanted to remove the outline for the white background. So this the version I ended up with. All other functionality, such as auto folder generation, is retained.
